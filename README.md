# Text Extraction from images using OpenCV and OCR (Optical Character Recognition)

OpenCV (Open source computer vision) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real time computer vision. It helps to process an image and apply various functions like resizing image, pixel manipulations and object detection etc. 
In this article, we learn how to use OpenCV to detect the text in an image and save it to a text file.

Required Installations:
1. Python 
2. Pip
3. OpenCV (pip install opencv-python)
4. Pytesseract (pip install pytesseract)

Download the tesseract executable file from the link(https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/releases).
