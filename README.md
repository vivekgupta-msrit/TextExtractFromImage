# Text Extraction from images using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) with Python, OpenCV and PyTesseract

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is the conversion of images of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text, whether from a scanned document, a photo of a document.

OCR consists generally of sub-processes to perform as accurately as possible.
1. Pre-processing
2. Text detection
3. Text recognition
4. Post-processing

OpenCV (Open source computer vision) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real time computer vision. It helps to process an image and apply various functions like resizing image, pixel manipulations and object detection etc. 
In this article, we learn how to use OpenCV to detect the text in an image and save it to a text file.

Tesseract OCR:
Tesseract is an open source text recognition (OCR) Engine, available under the Apache 2.0 license. It can be used directly, or using an API to extract printed text from images. It can be used with the existing layout analysis to recognize text within a large document.

Wand:
Imagemagick is a tool developed to convert images from one format to another. Wand is a binding developed for python by Imagemagick. Wand opens and manipulate images. Wand provides a large number of functions for image manipulation.

Required Installations:
1. Python 
2. Pip
3. Wand
4. ImageMagic
4. OpenCV (pip install opencv-python)
5. Pytesseract (pip install pytesseract)
